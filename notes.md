# Notes about python sockets:

**Host:** A host is a device connected to the network. To define a host in code, use the device's IP address.

**Port:** A port is like a numbered gate on a computer that allows different programs to send and receive information over a network. We can use different ports to do different functions. For example, maybe port 2000 echo's what you say and port 2001 accesses something from the servers database.
